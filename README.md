# My Neovim Configuration

This is the configuration file that I use for the vast majority of my programming in [neovim](https://neovim.io). I have this up mostly for myself if I ever have to set it up on another device, but I'm keeping it public in case I ever have to link something to someone or if anyone wants to look at it.
